      </p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Littyverse: Galaxy Dash</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”). We value your privacy and are
        committed to protecting your information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you
        use our mobile game and related services.
      </p>
      <p>
        By installing or using the game, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
      <p>
        The core game does not require account creation for basic gameplay.
        If optional features are added in the future (such as leaderboards, cloud saves, or support contact forms),
        we may collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Username or display name;</li>
        <li>Email address (optional);</li>
        <li>Information you include when you contact us for support or feedback.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <p>
        To improve gameplay and performance, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device model, operating system version, and language;</li>
        <li>Gameplay statistics (for example, scores, levels reached, items collected);</li>
        <li>Crash logs, error reports, and performance data;</li>
        <li>Basic usage analytics (for example, how often the game is opened).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is used in an aggregated or anonymized way and is not used to personally identify you.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        In some versions of the game, we may integrate third-party services such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Platform services (e.g., Google Play Games, Apple Game Center);</li>
        <li>Analytics services (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Game Analytics);</li>
        <li>Advertising networks (e.g., AdMob, Unity Ads), if ads are enabled.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These third parties may collect and process data according to their own privacy policies. We recommend
        reviewing those policies for more details.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We may use collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the game and related services;</li>
        <li>Fix bugs, crashes, and technical issues;</li>
        <li>Balance gameplay, difficulty, and in-game economy;</li>
        <li>Protect the integrity of the game and reduce cheating or abuse;</li>
        <li>Provide support if you contact us directly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your personal data to third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        Some versions of the game may display ads. When ads are enabled, advertising partners may use limited data
        (such as device identifiers, approximate location, and interaction with ads) to provide, measure, and
        improve the ads you see.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can typically limit or reset ad identifiers and disable personalized ads in your device settings.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect your information against
        unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure,
        and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gameplay data may be stored locally on your device and, if cloud features are enabled, on secure servers.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our game is designed to be family-friendly. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children
        under the age of 13 (or under the minimum age in your region) without verifiable parental consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so that we can
        investigate and remove the information if necessary.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your region, you may have certain rights regarding your data, such as the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request access to information we hold about you;</li>
        <li>Request correction or deletion of your information;</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain forms of processing;</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also manage many privacy settings directly in your device (for example, ad tracking, analytics, or
        permissions).
      </p>

      <h2>8. Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        The game or related pages may contain links to external websites or services that are not operated by us.
        We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the game, our practices, or legal requirements.
        When we do, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the game after
        any changes means you accept the revised policy.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>
