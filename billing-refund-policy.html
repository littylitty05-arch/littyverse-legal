  <h1>Billing & Refund Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. General</h2>
  <p>
    This Billing & Refund Policy applies to purchases made within
    <strong>Littyverse: Galaxy Dash</strong> (“the Game”) or related services.
    By making a purchase, you agree to this Policy in addition to our
    <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In-app purchases are processed by the platform provider (e.g. Google Play, Apple App Store).</li>
    <li>We do not collect or store your full payment card information.</li>
    <li>Prices and available items may change at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Virtual Currency & Items</h2>
  <p>
    The Game may include virtual currency or items (“Virtual Goods”).
    Virtual Goods:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are non-refundable and non-transferable, except where required by law;</li>
    <li>Have no monetary value outside the Game;</li>
    <li>Cannot be exchanged for real money or real-world goods.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    As a general rule, <strong>all sales are final</strong>. However, you may be
    able to request a refund directly from the platform store (Google Play,
    Apple App Store, etc.) under their own policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe a purchase was unauthorized or there was a technical issue
    (such as being charged but not receiving items), please contact us and
    include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Date and time of purchase;</li>
    <li>Platform (e.g., Google Play);</li>
    <li>Order ID / receipt screenshot.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Subscription Services (If Applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    If the Game offers subscriptions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled through the platform
        store before the renewal date;</li>
    <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription through your store account
        settings;</li>
    <li>Partial-period refunds are typically not provided, unless required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Chargebacks</h2>
  <p>
    If a chargeback or payment dispute is initiated, we may suspend or terminate
    access to the relevant account, purchases, or Virtual Goods while the issue
    is investigated.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. Changes will apply to future
    purchases. Your continued use of the Game after updates means you accept
    the revised Policy.
  </p>
